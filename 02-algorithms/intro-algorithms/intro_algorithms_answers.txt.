The below CALCULATE_TIP pseudocode is how I would determine how much to
tip for a specific quality of service given. It assumes the subtotal is fixed
and that the tip depends on quality of service (BAD/GOOD/OUTSTANDING)

DEF CALCULATE_TIP(TOTAL, SERVICE)
  SET TOTAL TO n

  CALCULATE_TIP
    IF SERVICE IS BAD
      No tip is added to the TOTAL
      TOTAL = TOTAL
    ELSIF SERVICE IS GOOD
      Set Tip to .18
      SET TOTAL to TOTAL MULTIPLIED by 1+.18
    ELSE SERVICE IS OUTSTANDING
      Set Tip to .22
      SET TOTAL to TOTAL MULTIPLIED BY 1+.22
    END IF
    RETURN TOTAL
END DEF


The COMMUTE_TO_WORK pseudocode uses time as the main parameter.
If I have more than 45 minutes, I will commute on the train unless my preferred train
has delays. In that case I use an alternative.
If I need to be at work in under 40 minutes I will take an uber.


DEF COMMUTE_TO_WORK(t)
  SET TIME_TO_COMMUTE to t

  IF t >= 40 min
    take the A train UNLESS A train is delayed
      else take the 1 train
  ELSE
    take an UBER to work
  END IF

END DEF


This WHAT_TO_WEAR pseudocode uses TEMPERATURE as the main parameter.
The colder it gets, the more heavy clothing is required.


DEF WHAT_TO_WEAR(t)
  SET TEMPERATURE TO t

  IF t >= 60
    WEAR LONG_PANTS + LONG_SLEEVE_SHIRT OR LONG_PANTS + SHORT_SLEEVE_SHIRT
  ELSIF t < 60 && t >= 50
    WEAR LONG_PANTS + LONG_SLEEVE_SHIRT + SWEATER
  ELSIF t < 50 && t >=40
     WEAR LONG_PANTS + LONG_SLEEVE_SHIRT + SWEATER + JACKET
  ELSE
    WEAR LONG_PANTS + LONG_SLEEVE_SHIRT + SWEATER + WINTER_COAT

  END IF

END DEF

1. Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint,
how many iterations would it take to find the value G using linear search?

It would take 7 iterations for our linear search to find the value "G" in an
alphabetically sorted collection. G is in the sixth index which makes it the
seventh item.

2. Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint,
 how many iterations would it take to find the value G using binary search?

ITERATION ONE
The binary search will set A as the LOW, D as the MID, and G as the High.
It will compare G to the mid and realize G is higher than D.

ITERATION TWO
The low becomes E (previous MID  plus one), F is MID, and the high remains G.
Everything below E is discarded.
We compare G to MID which is F.
F < G, so low is now F + 1 which is G


ITERATION THREE
G is the LOW, HIGH, AND MID. We found G.

3. Calculate fib(10), fib(11), fib(12) by hand.

fib (10) = fib(9) + fib (8) = 34 + 21 = 55

fib (11) = fib(10) + fib(9) = 55 + 34 = 89

fib(12) = fib (11) + fib(10) = 89 + 55 = 144

How does your data structure allow developers to access and manipulate the data?

*The array data structure is easy to manipulate and access using various array methods.

If a developer wanted to find a specific element in your data structure, how would you search for it?

*The array method "bsearch", short for binary search, allows a developer to verify if a specific element exists in the array.

What other real-world data can each structure represent?

This data structure could be used to represent a wide variety of list-like data.
For example, lines and queues perhaps can mimic requests for certain services on e-commerce sites or in-demand services.
Mailing lists, survey response data, etc come to mind.

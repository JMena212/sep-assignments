What is Spatial Locality and why does it benefit performance?

Spatial locality refers to the use of consecutive memory locations.
Arrays use up memory locations and are predictable in terms of memory addresses of
elements. Elements in an array are all next to each other in memory. This
benefits performance because it is cache-friendly. Linked Lists do not exhibit
spacial locality as each node is independent in memory. The operating system can
use any available memory location to store a node. Although this is helpful in
helping linked lists grow comfortably to large sizes, it can result in cache misses.
